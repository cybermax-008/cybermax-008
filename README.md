# Hello World ðŸ‘‹
I have worked/explored in multiple domains (Cloud infra, IoT, Embedded systems, ML). Currently serving as a Support Engineer at Aiven. Looking to equip myself with skills that will help me build sustainable solutions for real-world problems.

## ðŸš€ Currently exploring:
- Prompt engineering workflows
- n8n Ai workflows
- Building LLM based projects on general use-cases. Like AI KB assistants, RAG based Q/A bots, etc.
- Predominantly leveraging Gemini capabilities ( Long context, context caching, etc)

# Hello World ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a Senior Support Engineer at Aiven, where I focus on handling technical support tickets for services like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Kafka, and platform-level issues. My specialty is deep-dive troubleshootingâ€”reproducing issues, identifying bugs, and collaborating with SMEs to resolve complex challenges while managing customer expectations through diligent ticket follow-ups.

Beyond support, I independently build internal AI-powered tools and apps to streamline our workflows. I drive the full product lifecycle: pinpointing pain points, defining requirements, designing user experiences, developing solutions (using Python, Gemini, Zendesk APIs, n8n, and LLM agentic orchestration), and iterating based on team feedback. I prioritize features based on real input to ensure the tools I build deliver practical value.

## ðŸš€ Currently exploring:
- Context driven prompt engineering
- n8n Ai workflows
- Building LLM based projects on general use-cases. Like AI KB assistants, RAG based Q/A bots, etc.)

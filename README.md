# Hello World ðŸ‘‹
I have worked/explored in multiple domains (Cloud infra, IoT, Embedded systems, ML). Currently serving as a Support Engineer at Aiven. And, forever grateful and embrace Opensource.

## ðŸš€ Currently exploring:
- Backend development with Flask
- PostgreSQL
- Building LLM based projects on general use-cases.
- Predominantly leveraging Gemini capabilities ( Long context, context caching, etc)

## ðŸŒ± Always learning, always growing
I approach technology as a playground requiring constant adaptation and learning - to get equipped with tools/skills to build sustainable and painkiller solutions to the real-world problems.
